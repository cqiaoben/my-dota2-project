Before deployment:

replace <project_id>, <region_id>, <sql_instance>
 in workflow/yamlfile and workfile/dockerfile with your ids.

How to set up:
1. go to workflow folder
----- cluster set up -----
2. follow federated_cluster_setup to set up federated cluster
3. create db instance, enable cloud sql api for the project
4. run db_cmds to create tables etc. in db
5. run cluster_setup to set up get-match-id cluster
---- deployment ----
6. run launcher/kubectl.sh to get kubectl proxy with admin
   credential
7. create sql secret. follow guides in:
   https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-container-engine
   user role: editor instead of cloud sql editor
8. run launcher/starter.sh <version number >
   to set up service in get-match-id. update version number in 
   yamlfile/salt_node.yaml
9. run kuberctl --context=federation create -f \
   yamlfile/salt_service.yaml
10. run launcher/salt <version number> to start salt service

To clean up:
1. run launcher/clean_starter.sh
2. use commands in federated_cluster_setup to cleanup service and
   deployment
